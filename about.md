## Me
What’s in a name? I can’t answer that... but I can tell you that mine’s Rami Saab and that I’m another perpetually confused graduate student studying at the University of Toronto - Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering. I’m writing this blog because screaming some (hopefully) interesting/useful things into the void of the internet seems preferable to screaming into the void of academia. It is in the hopes that others smarter and more competent than I, may take something out of the posts I’ve wrote and, in the process, do some good.
